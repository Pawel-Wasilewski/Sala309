                    Nobel, an inventor and engineer, and Karolina Andriette Nobel (née Ahlsell). The couple married in
                    1827 and had eight children. Unfortunately, the family faced financial difficulties, and only Alfred
                    and his three brothers survived beyond childhood. <br>
                    From an early age, Nobel displayed an aptitude for science and learning. He was particularly
                    interested in chemistry and languages.

                <p>
                    By the time he was 24 years old, he had already filed his first patent. His curiosity extended to
                    mastering six languages, including English, French, German, Russian, and his native language,
                    Swedish. <br>
                    Nobel’s interest in technology was inherited from his father, who was an alumnus of the Royal
                    Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Following some business failures, Immanuel Nobel moved to
                    Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he became successful as a manufacturer of machine tools and
                    explosives.

                    Explosion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 1867, Nobel patented his most famous invention: dynamite. <br>
                    This powerful explosive combined nitroglycerin with a porous substance, making it safer to handle
                    and transport. Dynamite revolutionized various industries, enhancing safety in mining, railroad
                    construction, and other forms of infrastructure development. <br>
                    Prior to dynamite, nitroglycerin was highly volatile and challenging to use effectively. Nobel’s
                    innovation allowed controlled and efficient detonation, significantly impacting construction and
                    engineering practices.
                    <b>But</b> <br>
                    Quickly, Nobel's innowation from using in mining operation turned to a device of mass destruction
                    unaliving a lot of innocent people and turning them do dust. Nobel didn't want to this happen so
                    nobel resigned his chemist journey.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because Nobel patented the dynamite he had a lot of money from his invention. He founded in 1900 a <b> Nobel Foundation.</b><br>
                    Money what he made from dynamite was given to organization and started giving awards in form of Nobel's Prize  1 milion swedish corons (aprox. 914k Euro in 04.2024) to people what made great inpact to a human culture and humanity overall. <br> 
                    For example one of most popular Noblist is Maria Curie, a woman who got prize twice, one for discovering Polon and Rad, and second for overall impact on radioactive industry.

                    Death
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swedish inventor and philanthropist, passed away on December 10, 1896, in San Remo, Italy. He suffered a stroke at the
                    age of 63. Nobel was most famous for inventing dynamite and for founding the Nobel Prizes, which are awarded annually to
                    individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions to humanity in the fields of physics, chemistry,
                    physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. His last will and testament allocated a large portion of his fortune to
                    establish these prestigious awards. Nobel’s legacy continues to be celebrated through these prizes, which honor those
                    who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.
