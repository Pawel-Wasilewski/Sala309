                        Nobel, an inventor and engineer, and Karolina Andriette Nobel (née Ahlsell). The couple married in 1827 and had eight children. Unfortunately, the family faced financial difficulties, and only Alfred and his three brothers survived beyond childhood. <br>
                        From an early age, Nobel displayed an aptitude for science and learning. He was particularly interested in chemistry and languages.

                        By the time he was 24 years old, he had already filed his first patent. His curiosity extended to mastering six languages, including English, French, German, Russian, and his native language, Swedish. <br>
                        Nobel’s interest in technology was inherited from his father, who was an alumnus of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Following some business failures, Immanuel Nobel moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he became successful as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives.

                        Explosion

                    <p>
                        In 1867, Nobel patented his most famous invention: dynamite. <br>
                        This powerful explosive combined nitroglycerin with a porous substance, making it safer to handle and transport. Dynamite revolutionized various industries, enhancing safety in mining, railroad construction, and other forms of infrastructure development. <br>
                        Prior to dynamite, nitroglycerin was highly volatile and challenging to use effectively. Nobel’s innovation allowed controlled and efficient detonation, significantly impacting construction and engineering practices.
                        <b>But</b> <br>
                        Quickly, Nobel's innowation from using in mining operation turned to a device of mass destruction unaliving a lot of innocent people and turning them do dust. Nobel didn't want to this happen so nobel resigned his chemist journey.

                    <p>
                        Because Nobel patented the dynamite he had a lot of money from his invention he founded a <b> Nobel Foundation.</b> <br>
